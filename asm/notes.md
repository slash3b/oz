nasm -felf64 hello.asm creates an object file

`*.o` is an object file


we can disassembe it back with
`objdump -d hello.o`   

or better, from the comment
> By default, objdump uses the AT&T syntax for displaying assembly code. However, you can switch to the Intel syntax by using the -M option with the intel argument


so `objdump -d -M intel hello.o`  

what is an object file?

An object file is a file that contains machine code or bytecode, as well as other data and metadata, 
generated by a compiler or assembler from source code during the compilation or assembly process. 
The machine code that is generated is known as object code.
The object code is usually relocatable, and not usually directly executable.

then we have to use a linker to make this file executable.

`ld hello.o` 

then just `./a.out`
